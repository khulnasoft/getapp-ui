## States

To disable a radio button, add the following class:

| Attribute  | Type     |                                                        |
| ---------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `disabled` | Disabled | Use whenever clicking on a radio button isn't allowed. |

<Preview center>
  <input type="radio" name="radio-2" disabled />
  <input type="radio" name="radio-2" checked="true" disabled />
</Preview>

## Sizes

There are three sizes of selectors: small, medium, and large. Each size has its own purpose, so make sure you use every size correctly.

| class      | Type   |     |
| ---------- | ------ | --- |
| `is-small` | Small  |     |
| -          | Medium |     |
| `is-large` | Large  |     |

<Preview center>
  <only-preview>
    <div class="u-flex u-gap-16 u-main-center u-cross-center">
      <input type="radio" class="is-small" name="size" />
      <input type="radio" name="size" checked />
      <input type="radio" class="is-large" name="size" />
    </div>
  </only-preview>
  <only-html>
    <input type="radio" class="is-small" name="size" />
    <input type="radio" name="size" checked />
    <input type="radio" class="is-large" name="size" />
  </only-html>
</Preview>

## Best Practice

Radio buttons next to labels should have at minimum 8px of space in between for legibility. Radio buttons should be aligned to the center of a single line of text. If there are multiple lines in a label, the radio button should be aligned to the center of the first line in the label.

Radio buttons refer to a single item and allow selecting only one item from a list.
