title: Elevation
description: Elevation is the relative distance between two surfaces along the z-axis. Shadows and blurs create a layered effect that visually indicates that an object is "elevated" in priority or hierarchy.

## Types

In the GetApp console we use two types of elevation:

| Variable       | Type  |                                                                                                                  |
| -------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `shadow-small` | Small | Used to show contrast between layout elements, such as cards or tables, and their parent component.               |
| `shadow-large` | Large | Used to show contrast between 'floating' components, such as popovers, alerts or modals, and the components below. |

<Preview center>
  <div class="card" style="box-shadow:var(--shadow-small);">
    shadow-small
  </div>

  <div class="card" style="box-shadow:var(--shadow-large);">
    shadow-large
  </div>
</Preview>

## Best Practice

Small shadows should be used with standard layout components (e.g. cards, tables).

We recommend the use of a large drop-shadow for floating components (e.g. popovers, alerts, modals).

::::COMPARISON
::IMG[elevation-do-1.svg, large shadow]
:::DO
To create contrast between a floating surface and the surface beneath, use shadow-large.
:::
::IMG[elevation-dont-1.svg, no shadow]
:::DONT
Do not make floating elements look flat by not using shadows.
